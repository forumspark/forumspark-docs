# Board Template

There are currently 4 main sections to the theme templates: Head, Top of the page, Above the board and Below the board.  You can use these templates to add extra HTML and Javascript to transform the look and feel of your board.

## Head

Content you add here will be placed directly in the `<head>` of the overall layout.  This is useful for adding extra meta data, scripts or linking to other stylesheets and resources.

## Top of the page

The HTML placed here is the very first thing to be rendered.  This is output before the board and user menu.

## Above the board

The HTML here will be output after the sub navigation (Home / Members / Search etc.) but before the breadcrumb trail.

## Below the board

The HTML here will be output directly after the Theme Selector component and before the copyright.
