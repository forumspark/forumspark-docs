# Forum Spark Theme Guide

:::info WIP
Theming ForumSpark is a work in progress.  Please be aware that whilst we are still in MVP phase, some of these things will be subject to change and may have impact on your theme if you decide to create one.
:::

This section will give you an overview of how to approach theming with Forum Spark.  The idea was to give themers a level of control over the appearance of a ForumSpark board without making it too complicated in managing all of the individual templates that make up the whole board.

As such there are 3 main components that make up a theme: the stylesheet, the board template and the theme images.
