# Topic Templates

Topic templates allow you to prefill the topic creation form in a specific forum with structured content. This is especially useful for:

- Support forms (e.g. “Please describe your issue…”)
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Application templates

You can manage templates from the **Board Config** section in the Admin Control Panel.

## Creating a Template

To create a new template:

- **Name**: A label to identify the template in the admin area.
- **Content**: The prefilled content that will appear in the topic body when users create a new thread. This field supports BBCode.

## Applying a Template to a Forum

Once created, templates are not active until assigned.

To use a template in a forum:

1. Go to **Section Management**.
2. Edit the forum where you want to apply the template.
3. Select the desired topic template from the **Template** dropdown.

The selected template will now automatically populate the topic body for all new threads in that forum.

## Notes

- Only one template can be applied per forum.
- Templates can be edited at any time.
- Changing the template does not affect existing topics.
