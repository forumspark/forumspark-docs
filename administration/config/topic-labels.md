# Topic Labels

Topic labels let you tag discussions with short pieces of text that help categorize or highlight their purpose. They appear next to the topic title in forum topic lists.

Labels are most commonly used for things like:
- Marking threads as [Resolved], [Request], [In Progress]
- Highlighting important post types like [Bug] or [Idea]
- Structuring support forums with tags like [Mac], [Windows], [Mobile]

You can manage topic labels from the **Board Config** section of the Admin Control Panel.

## How Labels Work

Labels are added and edited by users or moderators through the **"Edit Topic Title"** option on the frontend. Only one label can be applied to a topic at a time.

Labels are shown in the topic list, right before the topic title.

## Adding a Label

To create a new label:

- **Content**: The label text. BBCode is supported.
- **Available in all forums**: Toggle this to make the label usable in every forum (global). When disabled, you can pick which specific forums should allow this label.
- **Available forums**: A list of forums where the label can be used (only shown when the label is not global).

## Notes

- Only one label can be assigned to a topic.
- Labels are visible to all users and can help enforce or suggest forum structure.
- Moderators can change labels on any topic.
