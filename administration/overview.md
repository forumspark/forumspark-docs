# Logging in to your admin panel

Managing your ForumSpark board is done through the Admin Control Panel (Admin CP) — a dedicated area where you can configure your board, manage content, and control user permissions.

## Accessing the Admin CP

To get started:

1. **Log into the user account** you created during forum registration.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click on your username to open the user menu:

3. From the dropdown, click **“Admin CP”**.

> 💡 Only users with administrator permissions will see the Admin CP option.

Once inside the Admin CP, you'll land on the **Admin Dashboard**:

- **Board Information**: Forum owner, registration date, and transfer ownership link (if you're the board owner).
- **Statistics**: Quick overview of your board’s activity — member count, topic count, posts, and average posts per day.
- Navigation links to configuration sections like:
    - Board Settings
    - Domain Manager
    - Support Forum & Changelog
    - Emoticons, Filters, Shoutbox, and more

## ✅ Next Steps
