# Log in to your admin panel

Managing your ForumSpark board is all done through the Admin Control panel.  Getting there is simple.  Log in to your user account that you created during registration then look for your user name in the top right corner and click it to expand your user menu.

Clicking the link called 'Admin CP' will take you to the administrator dashboard.

The administrator dashboard gives you access to all the things you can manage on your board.  The home screen will provide you with some basic statistics and insights to your board along with the option to transfer the board to a new owner if you are the board owner.
